title: Configuration
description: Choose Ascendant's ayanamsa and house system with explicit, typed, reproducible defaults.
---

`ascendant.configuration` owns the process-wide defaults used when a new
`Ascendant` instance does not receive an explicit ayanamsa or house system. The
configuration is one frozen `AscendantConfig`; calling `configure()` replaces
that complete value.

## Configure new instances

```python
from ascendant import (
    AscendantConfig,
    Ayanamsa,
    HouseSystem,
    configure,
)

config = AscendantConfig(
    ayanamsa=Ayanamsa.RAMAN,
    house_system=HouseSystem.PORPHYRY,
)
configure(config)
```

`AscendantConfig` is frozen and slotted. Its fields accept enum members, not
arbitrary strings. Passing a dictionary or another object to `configure()`
raises `TypeError`; passing strings into `AscendantConfig` also raises
`TypeError`.

The built-in value is equivalent to:

```python
AscendantConfig(
    ayanamsa=Ayanamsa.LAHIRI,
    house_system=HouseSystem.WHOLE_SIGN,
)
```

## Read and reset the configuration

```python
from ascendant import get_config, reset_config

current = get_config()
print(current.ayanamsa)
print(current.house_system)

reset_config()
```

`get_config()` returns the current immutable object. `reset_config()` replaces
it with a new default `AscendantConfig`, restoring Lahiri and Whole Sign.
Reads and replacements are protected by a lock, so callers do not observe a
partially changed configuration.

## How an instance resolves its settings

When you construct a chart without explicit calculation settings, it reads the
current application configuration:

```python
from ascendant import Ascendant

astro = Ascendant(
    year=1990,
    month=1,
    day=1,
    hour=12,
    minute=0,
    second=0,
    latitude=28.6139,
    longitude=77.2090,
    utc="+5:30",
)
```

The effective precedence is:

1. Explicit `Ascendant(...)` arguments
2. The current value installed by `configure()`
3. `AscendantConfig()` defaults

An existing instance keeps the resolved values stored in its
`horoscope_data`. Later calls to `configure()` affect only instances created
after the replacement.

## Override one instance

The `Ascendant` constructor accepts enum members:

```python
from ascendant import Ascendant, Ayanamsa, HouseSystem

astro = Ascendant(
    year=1990,
    month=1,
    day=1,
    hour=12,
    minute=0,
    second=0,
    latitude=28.6139,
    longitude=77.2090,
    utc="+5:30",
    ayanamsa=Ayanamsa.KRISHNAMURTI,
    house_system=HouseSystem.PLACIDUS,
)
```

It also accepts supported strings at this constructor boundary:

```python
astro = Ascendant(
    year=1990,
    month=1,
    day=1,
    hour=12,
    minute=0,
    second=0,
    latitude=28.6139,
    longitude=77.2090,
    utc="+5:30",
    ayanamsa="raman",
    house_system="equal_2",
)
```

Ayanamsa strings are matched case-insensitively against their exact values.
House-system strings are stripped, underscores become spaces, and comparison
is case-insensitive. For example, `"equal_2"` resolves to
`HouseSystem.EQUAL_2`. Unsupported strings raise `ValueError` while the
instance is being constructed.

## `Ayanamsa`

| Member | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Ayanamsa.LAHIRI` | `Lahiri` |
| `Ayanamsa.LAHIRI_1940` | `Lahiri_1940` |
| `Ayanamsa.LAHIRI_VP285` | `Lahiri_VP285` |
| `Ayanamsa.LAHIRI_ICRC` | `Lahiri_ICRC` |
| `Ayanamsa.RAMAN` | `Raman` |
| `Ayanamsa.KRISHNAMURTI` | `Krishnamurti` |
| `Ayanamsa.KRISHNAMURTI_SENTHILATHIBAN` | `Krishnamurti_Senthilathiban` |

## `HouseSystem`

| Member | Value | Swiss Ephemeris code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HouseSystem.WHOLE_SIGN` | `Whole Sign` | `W` |
| `HouseSystem.PLACIDUS` | `Placidus` | `P` |
| `HouseSystem.EQUAL` | `Equal` | `A` |
| `HouseSystem.EQUAL_2` | `Equal 2` | `E` |
| `HouseSystem.PORPHYRY` | `Porphyry` | `O` |

Ascendant maps these enums to Swiss Ephemeris in `horoscope.py`. Swiss
Ephemeris documents its
[sidereal modes](https://www.astro.com/swisseph-download/doc/swephprg.2.10.htm#_Toc112949044)
and [house methods](https://www.astro.com/swisseph-download/doc/swephprg.2.10.htm#_Toc112949056).

### Current chart-output boundary

The selected house-system code is used when Swiss Ephemeris calculates cusps
and angles. The current public `get_chart()` result still places one complete
sign in each numbered house from the rising sign and does not expose cusp
longitudes. In this release, a non-Whole-Sign setting changes the underlying
cusp calculation but not public `get_chart()` planet-to-house membership.

## Reproducibility

Store the resolved enum values with the birth timezone, coordinates, and
software version. When comparing two results, confirm those values before
investigating a difference in the calculated chart.
