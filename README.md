This site is the TypeScript documentation for Ascendant: a library for sidereal
astrology on npm as `astro-ascendant`. You can calculate charts, dashas, yogas,
Ashtakavarga, and Jaimini results, and you can use those results with coding
agents.

Python has its own docs in the
[ascendant repo](https://github.com/thaletto/ascendant/tree/main/docs/content).

## What you can learn

- How Ascendant calculates a chart, and which defaults it uses
- The difference between signs, houses, charts, and timing
- How Parashari, Jaimini, and KP approaches differ
- How saved person records work with agent skills
- How to install the TypeScript library and choose calculation settings
- What a reading can and cannot claim

## How calculations work

By default Ascendant uses the sidereal zodiac, Krishnamurti ayanamsa, and
Placidus houses.

Methods are named so you can check and repeat a result. A reading is guidance,
not certainty, and not a substitute for medical, legal, or financial advice.
